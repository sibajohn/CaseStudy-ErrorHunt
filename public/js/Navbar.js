//6.  Change me, first navbar will tell. I am an array of objects which can be modularised and kept somewhere as static data.

const nav= [
    {
        link:"/books",
        title:"Books"
    },
    {
        link:"/authors",
        title:"Authors"
    },
    {
        link:"/addbook",
        title:"Add Book"
    },
    {
        link:"/addauthor",
        title:"Add Author"
    }
]
